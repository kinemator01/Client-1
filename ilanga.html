    <h2>Garden / Landscape Maintenance</h2>
        <p>Hey there! We’re Ilanga Landscaping, and we’ve been turning outdoor spaces into beautiful, relaxing escapes since 2024. It all started with the founder, who had a simple goal: help people create gardens they love coming home to.

Whether you’ve got a small yard or a large property, we’re here to bring your vision to life — and make it even better than you imagined. From the first sketch to the final plant in the ground, we handle everything: design, build, and long-term care.

We believe a garden isn’t just something pretty to look at — it’s an extension of your home, a place to breathe, unwind, and enjoy life. We use only quality plants and materials, and we’ve built great relationships with trusted suppliers to help keep costs fair without cutting corners.

Need lighting, irrigation, a pool, or a water feature? No problem — we work with experienced pros to get it all done right.

At the end of the day, we’re not just building gardens — we’re building spaces that make people happy. And we’d love to build one for you.
